  # Build a class constructor `Song.new_by_name` that takes in the string name of a
  # song and returns a song instance with that name set as its name property.
  # `Song.new_by_name` should return an instance of `Song` and not a simple string
  # or anything else. Implement the following functionality:
  # song = Song.new_by_name("The Middle")
  #=> #<Song @name="The Middle">
  # song.name #=> "The Middle"
